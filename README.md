# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Using-Power-BI

Hi everyone!

I’m happy to share my first interactive HR Analytics Dashboard, created in Power BI, with help from Rishabh Mishra’s YouTube tutorial.

Objective:
--------------
The goal is to use data to help companies improve employee performance, keep employees longer, and reduce the number of people leaving.

Dashboard Features:
--------------------
Filters:
---------

Key Metrics:
----------------
Total number of employees,
Number of employees leaving (attrition) and the attrition rate,
Average age of employees,
Average salary,
Average years employees stay in the company

Steps I Followed:
---------------------
Cleaned the Data: Removed duplicates, renamed columns, and fixed data formats using Power Query.
Processed the Data: Loaded the cleaned data into Power BI.
Created Visuals: Used DAX formulas like COUNT, SUM, and CALCULATE to create charts and graphs for better understanding.

Main Findings:

The Life Sciences field has the highest attrition rate at 38%.

Age Group:
------------
Employees aged 26–35 leave the most.

Work Tenure:
